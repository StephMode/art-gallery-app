/* Develop Spotlight comp to show one art piece at random

First Approach:

- make it child of HomePage and use pieces comp to pull data

xx> ðŸŸ¡ passing down of data works, but I don't see how I can use props image, artist there there

Second Approach

- make it child of ArtPieces
so that it can make use of pieces and can call it's own props

xx> ðŸŸ¡ could work technically, but from a component structure perspective, it doesn'T make to much sense
!!> ðŸŸ¡ look at the wireframes again: the Spotlight is the HOMEPAGE, hence the comp should rather be child of homepage

Third Approach

âœ… - make it child of HomePage after all
âœ… - MathRandom should be implemented in HomePage where we have access to the data
âœ… - call props image, artist in spotlight
 âœ…- MathRandom shall then be stored in a variable so that it can be accessed as an index to the props
- props will then pass down randomized index of artist and imageSource as props in the comp
- Spotlight shall than serve as purely represenational component
